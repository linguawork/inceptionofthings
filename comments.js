/*
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    This line begins the configuration block for Vagrant. 
    The "2" is the version number of the Vagrant configuration 
    format being used. Vagrant's configuration system can 
    have different versions, and this line indicates you're 
    using version 2, which is the most common one. The do 
    |config| part is a Ruby block syntax that passes the 
    config object into the block, allowing you to set various 
    configuration options inside it.
