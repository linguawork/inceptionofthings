/*
    For your task, you don't strictly need both configurations. Here's a breakdown of the two configurations:

        DHCP Configuration (type: "dhcp", adapter: 1): This automatically assigns an IP address from the DHCP server. In your case, the task specifies that each machine should have a dedicated static IP (192.168.56.110 for the server and 192.168.56.111 for the worker), so you don't need DHCP for this task.

        Static IP Configuration (ip: "192.168.56.110"): This is the correct setting for your task since the task explicitly asks for specific IP addresses for each machine (192.168.56.110 for the server and 192.168.56.111 for the worker).

        Internal Network (virtualbox__intnet: "intnet"): This is fine because it ensures the machines can communicate with each other directly over a private network. This configuration is required if you want the machines to communicate without exposing their IPs to the host machine or the outside network.

    Summary:

    For your task, you only need the static IP configuration and internal network setup. The DHCP configuration is unnecessary because the IPs are predefined.

What's Changed:

    Removed the DHCP configuration (type: "dhcp", adapter: 1) for both the areggieS (server) and areggieSW (worker) machines.
    Kept the static IP configuration with ip: "192.168.56.110" for the server and ip: "192.168.56.111" for the worker.
    Kept the internal network (intnet) to allow the two machines to communicate with each other.

This updated configuration should meet the requirements of your task. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
